# Challenge Two

## Description
This was an even-numbered week, which means we got zero starter code. The assignment was to create our own personal portfolio website that we can continue to add to as we progress in the program. Right now my featured projects are last week's assignment, the prework study guide, and my barren wasteland of a myspace page -- which back in 2006 was the first place I learned any coding.

Software development is all about creating, and solving problems. Employers want to know your abilities as a potential hire, and having a portfolio website does exactly that. It's also a great tool to use while in the program, as you can build off of it and continue practicing what you've learned.

I learned a lot during this project. After completing it, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on flexboxes, and how the parent/child relationship works. I had made the exact layout I wanted, thinking that all i needed to do was add the links and I was good to go, but that was definitely not the case. I had to add more flex containers to keep my photos looking the way I wanted them to, and that took a lot of reworking my code.

Before starting it, pseudo classes confused me more than anything else. So much so that they were the last element I added to my project. But once I figured it out, it was funny realizing how easy it was. 


## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The website is for me to show off my skills in knowledge in the software development world, and for potential employers to see what I am capable of in hopes to land a great job after graduation.

## Credits
I had a lot of help along the way from my Tutor, Corrado Alfano, my TA Shawn Littrel, and my Instructor Jonathan Harvey.
